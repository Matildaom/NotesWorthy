      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>Here at NotesWorthy, we are a close-knit team of music professionals dedicated to helping artists achieve their goals. </p>
      <p>Matilda, a musician herself, started Notesworthy in 2024 after becoming disillusioned by the standard of professional services available to independent musicians. Notesworthy is a company that serves the musician and has the sole goal of providing reliable services of a high standard for a good price. </p>
      <p >We know what it's like struggling to bring your creative passions to fruition.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bolder;">We understand and we can help!</p>
